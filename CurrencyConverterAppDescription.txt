This is a Spring application that allows conversion between different currencies. The rates are available in a database as well as properties files. This project demonstrates the use of spring, web routes, layered architecture with service and controller layers, and dependency injection, and the use of ORM to access objects stored in separate databases. The app uses Postgresql for the Currency objects and mongoDB for the Wallet objects.
